# my_assistant
This is a project for my personal speech assistant. It may be adapted by you under the included license.
## Usage
### Purpose
This is a voice recognition tool, that listens to your command once before shutting down and has to be called before every usage.
### Recommendations
* I personally integrate it in my workflow with a keyboardshortcut.
* It throws a sh\*t-ton of errors yet works without problems. Just try it. 

## requirements
You need to install following modules:

* pyaudio
* SpeechRecognition

More packages might be needed, see the tutorial linked below.
## Referenced Tutorial
I took inspiration from [this useful ressource](https://realpython.com/python-speech-recognition/ "real pythons website") of realpython.
## Final Words 
This package is neither written in best-practice nor is ist finished in any way. For issues and questions please don't hesitate to contact me.
Your commitment is well appreciated.
